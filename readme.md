# Graphitti

Graphitti is an open source software developed by DD2XAlpha to mimic the functionallity of what Langgraph Studio does.

At the moment of this writting, Langgraph Studio is only available on Mac, so Windows and Linux users may need to have the web version hosted on langchain's website.

This application aims to run all locally and be able to see all the interactions that the AI made.

Ok, I was so desperate to add modify the UI, when I was running tests I couldn't bare my own creation ðŸ˜‚, so I have added:
- A purple color to work with bootstrap
- A better font from Google fonts ([Outfit](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit?categoryFilters=Feeling:%2FExpressive%2FCalm))
- [marked.js](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) 
- [Fontawesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome?tab=readme-ov-file)

Don't blame me, I'm so deeply interested in adding all the functions it requires, but I couldn't take it anymore

I know this app doesn't look as good as Langgraph Studio. But please wait patiently, I am more focused on adding features than the looks at this moment
